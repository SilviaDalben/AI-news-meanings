# AI-news-meanings

This repository aims to observe how the news discourse around the term "artificial intelligence" has evolved with the rise of generative AI systems.

We collected 32,506 news articles published by 256 media outlets in the United States between July 2022 and June 2023 using the Media Cloud search tool.  We used the advanced search mode and the query “artificial intelligence” limited to news outlets under the “United States – National” collection.

The dataset provides all the stories published with the selected query, the media outlet, date, link, and language.

For text analysis, we observed the words' co-occurrence in the news stories’ titles to generate a Word Cloud, and a BERTopic Modeling analysis to cluster these stories into groups and evaluate the main critical events that gained attention by the press.
